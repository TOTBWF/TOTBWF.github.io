<p>One of the most interesting things about typed functional programing is the idea that a type can be seen as a proposition, and a program as a proof. If you haven’t seen this before, stop reading this immediately, grab a nice hot bevarage, search “Curry Howard Isomorphism”, and get ready to get sucked down a rabit hole that you probably will never come out of.</p>
<p>When viewing programing through this lens, we see that every program we write is indeed a proof of some proposition. Type checking is proof verification, and type inference is finding the most general proposition that some proof proves. But there is one interesting aspect of theorem proving that we are missing, the holy grail of automated reasoning: proof synthesis. However, to solve this probleam, we need to take a diversion into a bit of Proof Theory.</p>
<h2 id="the-structure-of-proofs">The Structure of Proofs</h2>
<p>Every proof starts with a theorem, and every theorem presents a goal, namely, to provide some sort of evidence that the theorem is actually true. From there, we can use the rules available to us to either directly prove the goal, or to break down the goal into further subgoals. A proof is complete when there are no more subgoals left to solve. From this perspective, we can see that a proof forms a tree. As an example, lets do a very quick proof that <span class="math inline"><em>A</em> ⇒ <em>B</em> ⇒ <em>A</em> ∧ <em>B</em></span>.</p>
<p>Our initial goal is <span class="math inline"><em>A</em> ⇒ <em>B</em> ⇒ <em>A</em> ∧ <em>B</em></span>. To prove this, we can assume that <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is true, and see if we can prove <span class="math inline"><em>B</em> ⇒ <em>A</em> ∧ <em>B</em></span>. This gives us the subgoal. <br /><span class="math display"><em>A</em> ⊢ <em>B</em> ⇒ <em>A</em> ∧ <em>B</em></span><br /> As a quick notational note, you should read <span class="math inline"><em>H</em> ⊢ <em>P</em></span> as “Asssuming H is true, prove P”. Continuing our proof, let us repeat the same step for <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>, giving us the subgoal: <br /><span class="math display"><em>A</em>, <em>B</em> ⊢ <em>A</em> ∧ <em>B</em></span><br /> To prove <span class="math inline"><em>A</em> ∧ <em>B</em></span>, we need to create 2 subgoals, one for <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and the other for <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>. Now our subgoals look like this: <br /><span class="math display"><em>A</em>, <em>B</em> ⊢ <em>A</em></span><br /> <br /><span class="math display"><em>A</em>, <em>B</em> ⊢ <em>B</em></span><br /> In both of our subgoals, we have assumed the thing we are trying to prove is true, so the proof is complete! The full proof tree looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/tikz/proof-tree.png" /></p>
<p>Putting on our magic Curry-Howard glasses, this proof tree looks suspiciously like an abstract syntax tree…</p>

<p>If only we had some way to programatically construct syntax trees…</p>
<h2 id="proof-synthesis-as-metaprogramming">Proof Synthesis as Metaprogramming</h2>
<p>As it turns out, just as we can create a programming language that creates programs, we can create a programming language that actually creates proofs! This sort of language is what as known as a <em>Tactic Language</em>, and is a key component of most proof assistants. <!-- The main difference between macro-based metaprograming and tactic metaprograming is that macros operate on ASTs, whereas --> <!-- tactics operate on incomplete proofs. --></p>
<p>Let’s sketch out a toy tactic language for simply typed lambda calculus with products, where the goals will be types along with a list of variables bound to types, and the proofs will be terms.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$
\begin{align*}
    t ::=&amp;\: intro \\
        |&amp;\: assumption \\
        |&amp;\: id \\
        |&amp;\: *t \\
        |&amp;\: ?t \\
        |&amp;\: t\: |\: t \\
        |&amp;\: t; t \\
        |&amp;\: [t_1, t_2, ..., t_n] \\
        |&amp;\: \{t\}
\end{align*}

<!-- The notation $(x:a) \vdash g \triangleright t$ should read as "Given that the variable $x$ has type $a$, prove the goal $g$, and when it is proved, return the term $t$". -->
<!-- With that in mind, the rules for the language are as follows: -->
<!-- - $\\{t\}$: Just acts as parentheses. -->
<!-- - $intro \: H \vdash a \rightarrow b$: Creates a subgoal $H,a \vdash b \triangleright t$, and returns a term $\lambda x.t$ -->
<!-- - $intro \: H \vdash a \times b$: Creates 2 subgoals  -->
<!-- $H \vdash a \triangleright l$ and -->
<!-- $H \vdash b \triangleright r$, and returns $(l,r)$. -->
<!-- - $assumption \: H,(x:a),H' \vdash a$: Creates no subgoals, and returns $x$. -->
<!-- If $intro$ is applied to any other type, or $\text{assumption}$ can't -->
<!-- find a varaible of the proper type, they will fail. -->
<!-- - $id \: H \vdash a$: Creates one subgoal $H \vdash a \triangleright t$,  -->
<!-- and returns $t$. At the moment, this seems super useless, but there is a very good reason for it (Try to guess!). -->
<!-- - $*\{t\}$: Runs a tactic repeatedly until it fails. For example:  -->
<!-- $*\{intro\} \: H \vdash a \rightarrow b \rightarrow c \rightarrow d$ -->
<!-- creates the subgoal $H,(x:a),(y:b),(z:c) \vdash d \triangleright h$ and  -->
<!-- returns $\lambda x. \lambda y. \lambda z. h$. -->
<!-- and will return a term $\lambda x.t$. -->

<p>I’m using the <a href="https://github.com/totbwf/refinery">Refinery</a> library here to handle the nitty gritty of proof refinement, so we can focus on playing with the tactics side of things. I plan on writing a full explanation of the inner workings</p>
<pre><code>(&gt;&gt;) = (&lt;&gt;)
t &gt;&gt;= f = t &lt;&gt; with f

$(let t = do
  many intro
  assumption
in refine t [t| forall a b. a -&gt; b -&gt; (a,b) |])

let t = do
  intro
  x &lt;- intro
  y &lt;- intro
  intro &lt;..&gt; [use x, use y]</code></pre>
<!-- ```haskell -->
